## Summary

Your 2024 Wrapped is here!

The end of our regular season has hit. Luckily, we kept receipts.

Prad spent 93,426 minutes yapping about the rules. That's 26 days nonstop.

Savan was ranked last in draft grades this season with a C+. He finished with the highest PF at 2032.38, he was in his "honk attack screenshot sending
max rizz" phase!

On the other hand, Ishan recorded the most PA with 2026.08 which was 163.08 more than the lowest PA. That's the top 0.01% of shitters! BOOOOOM 💪

SIKE. Mike was actually the highest PF at 2033.68, edging Savan out by 1.3 points. Savan is really in his "med school winter arc depression"
phase! DOOOOOM 💣

Joey had 11 wins, the only team to record double digit wins this season. His top scorer? Josh Allen. Allowing Brian a record 6 taunts for a single player
in a week! (And scoring 51.88 for Joey in a throwaway game)

Ian finished Top 3 for the first time in Stonks history? That's anything but mid. Proving Ishan wrong deserves... 5 BIG BOOOOOMS

BOOM 💪 BOOM 💪 BOOM 💪 BOOM 💪 BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM 💪

Neil missed the playoffs, meaning the draft grade curse worked! No 3-peat for him! Unfortunately, Neil luck has allowed the punishment to be something
he may quite enjoy doing. DOOOOOM 💣

## HOT-TAKE-BIT

Sam didn't send me the Thanksgiving post that would've brought power rankings back sooner.

## Playoff Predictions

(1) Joey vs (4) Prad

(2) Savan vs (6) Mike

Finals:

(1) Joey vs (6) Mike

Champion: (1) Joey

## Notes

* I hope you enjoyed power rankings as much as I did this year. I apologize for the hiatus, the website breaking, shit season, and prioritizing NBA PRA played a large factor.
* Hoping next season will be more active and consistent. Good luck in playoffs!
* Neil, we went from superbowl to toilet bowl in 2 seasons. Time to lock in and not Brett Maher I guess 🤷‍♂️
