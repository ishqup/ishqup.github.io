## Week Recap

The championship this past season was scuffed, with the unfortunate fall of Damar Hamlin we were unable to play out the matchup 
of Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs vs Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase. Neil as the 6-seed beat the 1-seed Ishan in a kicker battle, 
with Justin Tucker easily beating the goose egg of Brett Maher. This was the first of two times Ishan choked against Neil having
lost the March Madness Tournament Challenge group as well. Joey has yet to complete his punishment, where he is required to 
produce an album where he will cover 2 songs and write 1 original song. Overall, a disappointing season for everyone as we let 
Neil once again beat us out with his unbelievable luck. He joins 2020 Champion Prad and 2021 Champion Sam as the third winner
in the Stonks Era since the league transitioned to 8-Man PPR 2 Flex in 2020. Congratulations Twig!
